# Compose component design

## Core principle

Make reusable components caller-placeable and caller-composable: the component
owns its invariant structure while callers retain placement, content, and
policy choices that vary by use.

## Procedure

1. State the requested API concern and keep the edit within it. A focused slot
   review does not authorize unrelated modifier, naming, or cleanup changes.
2. State the component's invariant visual structure and identify every varying
   region, placement concern, and policy choice. In a broad API review, inventory
   all rendered regions, including hard-coded text or icons, before deciding
   which are fixed semantic content and which vary by caller. When the request
   names more than one concern, report each one; do not stop after the first
   valid modifier or slot finding.
3. When root placement is part of the requested work or a broad component API
   design, accept and apply a caller modifier at the component root unless a
   concrete API boundary makes another placement correct.
4. Represent caller-controlled, unconstrained visual regions with slots rather
   than proliferating primitive content parameters or Boolean shape flags.
   Keep semantic and design-system constraints as primitive parameters.
5. Keep simple conditional structure inline; extract only a coherent reusable
   contract.
6. Read the relevant focused reference below before editing public signatures.
7. In a review, decide explicitly whether each requested variable visual region
   should remain a semantic primitive or become a caller slot; naming a content
   limitation alone does not make that API decision. Finish with no edit when
   the existing API already satisfies the requested concern. Otherwise finish
   when callers can position the component, supply variable content, and
   understand ownership without hidden switches.
